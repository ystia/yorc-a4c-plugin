# Run Job commands without providing any artifact


JobOne is a bash loop
JobTwo is a srun command with an accessible path executable demo.sh

JobTwo depends on JobOne so is executed when JobOne is done successfully

demo.sh is very simple
$ cat demo.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "hey $NAME, whaouuuuuh this demo is awesome !!!"
